1. *Optimizing Waste Collection:*

Our project tackles the inefficiency of traditional waste collection by optimizing pickup routes based on real-time bin fullness and waste type detected through sensors and AI.
We eliminate overflowing bins and unnecessary trips by predicting waste levels and directing collection based on actual needs, saving time, fuel, and resources.
2. *Improving Recycling Rates:*

Our system empowers accurate waste classification using AI, ensuring proper sorting and significantly increasing recycling rates, diverting valuable materials from landfills.
By educating users about correct disposal through the app, we promote responsible waste management and create a circular economy for resources.
3. *Encouraging Public Participation:*

Our app engages citizens in waste management by allowing them to report overflowing bins, identify illegal dumping, and track collection schedules, fostering accountability and community involvement.
We gamify waste disposal and reward responsible behavior, making sustainability a collective effort and driving positive change.
4. *Reducing Environmental Impact:*

Our system minimizes greenhouse gas emissions from unnecessary collection trips and landfill methane production by efficiently managing and processing waste based on accurate classification.
We contribute to a cleaner environment and a more sustainable future by promoting responsible waste disposal and resource recovery.
